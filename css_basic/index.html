            <h2>Introduction to Steampunk</h2>
            <p>Steampunk is a genre that presents the idea of advanced technology based on steam engines. It usually tends to be an entire society based on this technology or sometimes just a few elements. The Time Machine and The War of Worlds by H G Wells are one of the first pieces of fiction of this genre. In fact, many consider him the father of it.</p>

            <h2>The Aesthetic of Steampunk</h2>
            <p>Visually, steampunk is characterized by its use of brass, copper, and other metals, along with leather, wood, and Victorian-era fashion. It tends to be heavy on brown, orange and yellow colors, also metallic ones such as copper yellow, silver grey and whatnot. It usually doesn't feature a colorful world, as it tends to clash against its themes.</p>

            <h3>Literature and Media</h3>
            <p>Speaking of themes, steampunk tends to be an imaginative exploration of steam technology and an alternate world that relies heavily on it, which is often used as criticism of the exploitation of the working class, which is who keeps these engines running. Steampunk societies tend to be inspired by the Victorian era and their social classes tend to be used too, and as such, class critique tends to be at the center of steampunk.</p>

            <h3>Community and Culture</h3>
            <p>The steampunk community is still alive today, with plenty of artists drawing multiple images of characters designed with steampunk attire, steampunk background and cities, all with imaginative ideas. A lot of people also engage in creating themselves steampunk attire and wearing them as a costume, with some amazing results.</p>
