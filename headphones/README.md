üíªFor this exercise, the goal is to create a website for a fictional heaphones company.üíª
This exercise, however, will not offer us the HTML code ready to go, like the last time. The challenge this time is to code both the HTML and the CCS ourselves, to show the skills we have acquired through the month. We are given the layout expected from us through a Figma blueprint and the assets necessary to make it happen (the icons and the images). The rest is us to us.

‚Äº‚ÄºÔ∏èDISCLAIMER‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è: I decided to have everything on the 7-index and 7-css file as I worked in different order from the one indicated on ALX exercise and so I do find it convoluted to separate e everything in all the different documents asked. Everything is present in the same HTML and the same CSS file.

‚ö†Ô∏èCHALLENGES‚ö†Ô∏è
They go without saying. If coding HTML and CSS was a challenge, having to take care of both at the same time was an experience of its own. Through trial and error and asking lots of people for help as well as looking this online, I did ended up achieving the result expected, or at least, close to it. It was extremly time consuming but the final result left me satisfied despite not being perfect.

‚ô®Ô∏èELEMENTS‚ô®Ô∏è
The website is composed of a header with the logo of the company as well as some links to different parts of the website. The intro has a big background picture with some text in it. The text doens't really say anything relevant, it's the placeholder Lorem Ipsum text. A button is included in this front page. We keep going down and find more information on the website about the different aspects, then we move forward to "our results", with its own background picture. Finally a contact section with the ability to write and finally the footer to close the page with the copyright name and the logo, as well as links to social media.
