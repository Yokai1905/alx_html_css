💻SMILE SCHOOL WEBSITE💻

For this project I have tried to stylize the website for Smile 😄 School, a ficticious school for smiling lessons. 

📁OBJECTIVE📁

I was provided with a base HTML file that I was supposed to build upon adding my own elements to complete it.
In addition, add a Styles.css file that complements the HTML file to stylize the website and give it an appealing appearence.
The blueprint of how the final result was meant to look like was given to me via a prototype on Figma.

💎EXPERIENCE💎
This task was indeed very challening📛. The final result is not equal to the blueprint given, some tweaks are needed, mainly the 
placement of some elements, which turned out to be challenging to move due to an unresponsiveness to the code I wrote. I must've made
mistakes along the way that I am not aware of that didn't allow me to move everything as I wanted.
The final result still looks close enough to the blueprint I'd say. This work took many, many hours and was exhausting for a begginer,
but came with the major upside of learning a lot and getting way more comfortable with coding and spending hours on Visual Studio Code.
A challenging but a rewarding experience.⬆️⬆️
